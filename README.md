# WatermelonSeedClassifier
an app that classifies watermelon seed x-ray images to triploid and tetraploid with a user interface <br />
## GUI <br />
this is the initial version for the GUI <br />
to view the GUI first you need to : <br />
1. download streamlit in your work environment <br />
2. download this streamlit component <br />
```
pip install st-pages 
``` 
in your work environment : you can view its documentation through [this link](https://github.com/blackary/st_pages ) <br />
3. join the model_clean.h5 file in folder " pcd" locally as it was too heavy to be uploaded on github <br />
4. run the following commands to run the app : - cd "all files that leads to pcd folder " <br />
                                               - cd pcd<br />
                                               - streamlit run app.py<br />
### other info <br />
* you can add any  animated images ( like the watermelon) using lottie animations : you will need to install the lottie library<br />

```

```
[here is the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXSOitGoINE) that will help you integrate this lottie animations , its a 3 min video dont worry won't take much of your time XD 
* note that the User Interface is still under construction , as well as the design and colors used , i ** highly recommend ** adding the changes needed on colors ,.. because it wasn't  well thought out decisions XD
